Finally setup my GIT Repo,
This revision is Based on work of all developers and tester at DIYDrones community.
This is just my little bit to add, Remzibi OSD with Call Sign 

For Ublox to give accurate HDOP pleae turn on NAV-DOP using uCenter
my Default Config_OSD uses GPS PROTOCOL UBLOX_DL

for standard UBOX use: GPS PROTOCOL UBLOX

This is Only for Traditional Heli no Quads yet,

Mode control is set for CH-7, Camera_Roll on CH-5, Camera_Tilt on CH-6

I have a custom mix for DX-7 that uses GEAR, and AUX2 to point camera straight down or GEAR  for looking 30Â° to right. 
GEAR turns OSD display 'on' or 'off' 
AILERON nudges Roll, PITCH nudges TILT, RUDDER can control Yaw (not enabled)

I will ad more info as I update files.

there will be A seperate Repo for Quads and Fixed Wing
